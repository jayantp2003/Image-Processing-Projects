<h1>Image Processing projects using opencv library</h1>

This is a image processing based project. In this project I have used a demo image and some dataset from internet listing about the color specifications. I have used the tools provied by the opencv library to process the image.

To Run this project on your device you should have installed python and pip in your device.
Use your terminal to install the opencv library using pip.

<h3>>>pip install opencv-python</h3>

<p>Now you can download these files and run the color_detect.py file to see how the code is working</p>

Hope you enjoy.ðŸ˜Š

```sh
  pip install opencv-python
```
